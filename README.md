# Skip The Rope

This is a fun webapp that counts skips when you're rope jumping.

It was built by Sofia and I during a day hackaton in Facebook, London. This app made first place! :)

It uses the devicemotion API to count your skips, so it should be run on a browser that implements this API, on a device that gives access to this data to the browser.

For example, you can try:

- Safari on iOS
- Firefox on Android
- natively on Firefox OS :)

Thanks to London Facebook for organising the women in computing hack.

The nice install functionality for Firefox is based on [fxosstub](https://github.com/Jaxo/fxosstub).

# Skip The Rope

This is a fun webapp that counts skips when you're rope skipping (and you have your phone in your pocket).
Test it [here](http://alicelieutier.github.com/skiptherope/).

It was built by Sofia and I during a day hackaton in Facebook, London. This app made first place! :)

It uses the devicemotion web API to count your skips, so it should be run on a browser that implements this API, on a device that gives access to this data to the browser.

For example, you can try:

- Safari on iOS
- Chrome or Firefox on Android

Thanks to London Facebook for organising the women in computing hack.
